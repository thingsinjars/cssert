    <h2>Make sure your styles don't change when your files do.</h2>
    <p>When working on a large project, you sometimes need to refactor your CSS. If you aren't constantly aware of all the different dependencies, you can end up altering the styles somewhere unexpected. This framework is designed to help you create key test cases linked to your styles. If the tests pass after refactoring, you can be sure your design is intact.</p>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>This works by generating a simple HTML skeleton unit which matches the minimal page structure around the element whose styles you want to test. This unit contains references to your project's CSS. You can then refactor your CSS as much as you like and as long as the styles amount to the same visual appearance, the test will continue to pass.</p>
    <h2 class="pass">Usage</h2>
    <p>The easiest way to create test cases is to install the bookmarklet. To generate a test unit, load a page whose styles you want to maintain then run the bookmarklet. If you click on an element, the test case will be generated in the floating panel. Copy and paste this into the test section of the <a href="blank-test-page.html">standard test page</a>. Open that page in a browser now and all the tests should pass. You can now refactor your CSS and the tests will let you know if something has changed unexpectedly.</p>
    <p>There is also a command-line version of the tool which is built
    on <a href="http://phantomjs.org">PhantomJS</a>. Check the <a href="https://github.com/thingsinjars/cssert/blob/master/readme.md">readme</a>
    provided in the project for more information.</p>
    <h2>Bookmarklet</h2>
    <p class="bookmarklet"><a href="javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://cdn.rawgit.com/thingsinjars/cssert/master/lib/generate-tests.js';})();">Generate Tests</a></p>
    <h2 class="fail">Limitations</h2>
    <p>This isn't any good for Test-Driven Development. Due to CSS and HTML both being declarative, by the time you've written your test case, you'd really have been better off writing the actual HTML. Especially as you could then have used the bookmarklet to generate the test case.</p>
    <p>They may be a point in the future where the visual designer on a project could specify the test case beforehand but until then, this is best used to help with refactoring.</p>
